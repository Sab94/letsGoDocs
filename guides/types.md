# Types

See the [types' concepts](../concepts/concepts.md#types) for details.

## How to create a controller?

There are two ways to create a type:
 - Using the CLI `letsgo-cli generate type user_type`. Read the [CLI documentation](../cli/CLI.md#letsgo-cli-generatetype) for more information.
 - Manually create a Go file named `user_type.go` in `./types`.
